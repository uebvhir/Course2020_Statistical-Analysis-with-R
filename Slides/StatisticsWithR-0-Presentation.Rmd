# Introduction

## Outline

- Introduction
    + Who are we ("we"=teachers & students)
    + Why are we here (Why learn R?) 
- How will we proceed: Methodology
- HW Data Science approach to using R
- References & Resources


## Who are we (1): The Statistics and Bioinformatics Unit

## Why this course (1)

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

"We are drowning in information but starving for knowledge"

## Why this course (2)

- (Biomedical) research, as well as many other human activities (social networks, sports, COVID ...) generate huge quantities of -often complex-  data.
    + Although sometimes we will also have small datasets
- We believe that data leads to information that leads to knowledge, but we need to be able to extract one from the other.
- This can be attempted in many ways, artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science or something which is common to all of them: __plain statistics__!!!
    
## What are our goals (1)

- The main goal of this course is to introduce a variety of statistical methods and tools, which is good enough to:
    + Help you analyze your own data when it makes sense
    + Suggests you when the analysis is complex enough to contact an expert statistician (such us those in the UEB)
    + Help you to distiguish one from the other
    
<p></p>

- A secondary, but not least important objective: Show how to do it using R

## Course contents

- This is a Standard course on Statistics using R
    - Exploratory Analysis
    - Introduction to Inference
    - Common regression models in biostatistics
    
- If there is anything else you would like to learn, let us know and we'll try not to let it out.


## Why learn R

- Most people in most jobs have to _manage_ information in their every day work.
- "Managing" may mean different things such as: 
    + _retrieving_
    + _manipulating_
    + _visualizing_
    + _analyzing_
    + _reporting_
    
- R is a powerful tool that can be used to facilitate, improve or automate tasks such as those described above.

## Why doing statistics with R

- R has become a "de facto" standard for statistical analysis
- Practically all existing statistical methods available
- Powerful graphics that can be used interactively to explore data
- Possibility of scripting analysis $\longrightarrow$  __Reproducibility__

## Hadley Wickam's approach to learning and applying Data Sciendce

## Your turn

- Provide examples of informations you may wish to manage
- Describe briefly 
    + what this information is about
    + how it is stored
    + what you may wish to do with it
        - Transformations
        - Computations
        - Reports

## How we will work

- Mastering R requires as many other disciplines
    (i) Time 
    (ii) Study, and 
    (iii) Practice.
    
- Our lectures will have the following structure (all but the first)

    + 1st part: Discuss the work you have done during the week
    + 2nd part: We introduce a few new ideas
    + 3rd part: Practice exercises and start working on the case study suggested/your data.
    
## Evaluation

- This course needs to be evaluated in order to obtain a certification.
- Evaluation consists of
  - Multple choice test to be taking the last session
  - Class atendance and participation (class atendance should be at least 80%)
