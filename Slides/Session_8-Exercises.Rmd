# Exercise 1

- Select one of the datasets that you have worked with during the course
    - diabetes.xls
    - osteoporosis.csv
    - demora.xls
    
 - Read the dataset into R and check that the categorical variables you are interested in are converted into factors.
 
 - Confirm the conversion by summarizing the variables
 
 
# Exercise 2
 
- Use the diabetes.sav file and import it into R with the "Import from SPSS" feature.

  - What is the class of the "MORT" variable.
  
  - Turn it into one factor so that it has the same levels as when you read it using `read.csv`
  
  
# Exercise 3

- With the osteoporosis dataset repeat the crosstabulation done above using 

  - Two categorical variables
  - Variable "MENOP" and a newly created variable "catBUA" created by properly categorizing variable BUA.
  
```{r}
osteo100 <- read.delim("datasets/osteo100.txt", stringsAsFactors=TRUE)
osteoOrderd <- osteo100[order(osteo100$bua),]
osteo100$buaCat <- cut (osteo100$bua, c(0,50, 75, 100)) #https://www.r-bloggers.com/2012/09/from-continuous-to-categorical/
table(osteo100$buaCat)
with(osteo100, table(buaCat, clasific))
```
