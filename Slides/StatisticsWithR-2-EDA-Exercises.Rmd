## Exercise I

- Load the osteoporosis dataset

- Proceed similarly as to what we have done above and obtain information on

  - How many variables and observations
  - How are them
  
## EXERCISE II

With the `diab` dataset

  - Show only the rows from 35 to 98 and columns 5, 7, and from 9 to 11

  - Change the level of the variable *tabac*, from **No Fumador** to **No\_Fumador**

  - Recode the BMI variable into a factor defined by 
  
    - Thin: < 20
    - Normal [20-25)
    - Overweight [25-30)
    - Obese >= 30

  - Display the mean of *edatdiag*, grouped by *ecg*


## Exercise III

  - Read the `osteoporosis.csv` data set  into R so that character variables are automatically converted into factors.
  
  - Make a summary of the dataset using standard and non-standard summary functions.
  
  - Display the range of `bua`, grouped by `clasific`
  
## Exercise IV

- With the variables in the osteoporosis dataset

- Try to represent the different variables using _the most appropriate plot_ for each of them.
